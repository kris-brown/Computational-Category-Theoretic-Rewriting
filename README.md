# Computational-Category-Theoretic-Rewriting
This repo contains a notebook to accompany the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03784).

It also contains the code used to generate benchmark data.

This was written prior to the development of [AlgebraicRewriting.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicRewriting.jl) which is the recommended way of performing rewriting within [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/).
